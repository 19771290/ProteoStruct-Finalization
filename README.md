# ProteoStruct-Finalization
This scripts visualizes  peptide data on protein structres and was completed in fufilment of the Stellenbosch University Honors course
This script is designed to work through the pymol.exe under the scripts folder in the PyMOL stored path. This was unable to be inrtegrated to hardware failure but will be implemented when possible.

This script is designed to visualize proteomic data via peptide structures.

Usage: Supply Peptide lists and PDB files and generate images via GUI

Requirements: Biopython, PyMOL, Peptide lists and PDB files  

The script needs to be run through pymol.exe (C:\Users\ingwe\PyMOL\Scripts) in order to carryout the desired functions 

The location of the script and command lines need to be supplied for the script to run 

Once correctly run the script should proft the user for the list of peptides to be analyzed by the script 

The script should then promptthe user to supply a folder with the desired PDBs to match the peptides to 

The script should then request a storage location for the images of the structres. 

If no images are generated the script with terminate
